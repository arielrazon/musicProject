# musicProject

## What is the idea?
We're creating a WebApp that allows users to list the songs/albums that they've recommended to other people and to track whether that person actually listened to it. Like a music accountability app.

There should be a live feed of music from apple music/spotify (oAuth??) that shows what the user has currenty listened to, to other users. 


## MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT

### ideas

conrad: last.fm scrobbling feature? can hook it up to itunes or whatever music you're listening and records all the songs to a feed. 

ari: integration with podcast apps???
